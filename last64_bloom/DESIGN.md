# 🕹️ Last64 (Abstract Style)
A minimalist reimagining of *Vampire Survivors* for the Nintendo 64 using `libdragon` and `tiny3d`. All visuals are abstract — inspired by *REZ* and *Geometry Wars* — relying on bloom and simple shapes for aesthetic effect.

## 🎨 Visual Style
- No textures or sprites
- Use triangles, circles, and quads for all entities
- Color-coded shapes with bloom blending
- Rely on additive glow and density for "intensity"
- Stylish, clean, abstract — looks good with low effort

## 🧩 Core Concepts
| System            | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Player**        | Triangle or diamond shape, glows with color |
| **Enemies**       | Triangles or circles with color per type |
| **Projectiles**   | Glowing lines or thin quads |
| **XP Orbs**       | Floating dots that glow and pulse |
| **GUI**           | Line-based HUD (health, XP, level) |
| **Multiplayer**   | (Optional) Shared-screen co-op |
